# Team task manager 

The task manager intended to improve the efficiency of the IT team. It makes tasks' info clear and displays
who is responsible for each task and what qualification each task performer has. All information
is easy to add, update, or delete from the database.

## Installing / Getting Started

The site will be displayed at once after the "python manage.py runserver" command is launched from the terminal.

### Initial Configuration

To get access to all the functionality feel free to use superuser credentials:

**login: superadmin**

**password: RogerThat1**


## Developing

To start developing pay attention to 
task_manager:
- models.py,
- views.py,
- urls.py
- forms.py. 

The entire project app structure is described there.
Tests.py will be widened in the future with additional checks to make functionality harm less probable.
It is highly recommended to launch the server more frequently because it lets developers see changes in
real-time.

## Testing

The tests.py file will be expanded in the future to include 
additional checks, ensuring the functionality is robust 
and error-free.

## Real-time development
Frequent server launches using python manage.py runserver are 
highly recommended during development. This practice allows developers 
to observe changes in real-time and ensures a smoother development 
experience.

Feel free to contribute to the improvement of the 
Task Manager, and make sure to adhere to best practices in 
Django development. If you encounter any issues or have suggestions, 
please open an issue on the project repository.
